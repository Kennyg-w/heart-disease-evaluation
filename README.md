# Clinical Heart Disease Classifier (Evaluation Metrics Project)

## 📊 Project Overview
Built a diagnostic tool using the UCI Cleveland Heart Disease dataset to classify patients and evaluate model performance beyond simple accuracy.

## 🛠️ Technical Achievements
- **High-Stakes Evaluation:** Moved beyond accuracy to implement **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score** metrics.
- **Risk Analysis:** Utilised a **Confusion Matrix** to identify and quantify critical "False Negative" diagnostic errors.
- **Clinical Preprocessing:** Handled missing biometric data and performed feature scaling for Logistic Regression.
- **Metric Prioritisation:** Successfully argued for the prioritisation of **Recall (83%)** in a medical context to minimise patient risk.

## 🐍 Tech Stack
- Scikit-Learn (LogisticRegression, metrics), Pandas, Seaborn.
